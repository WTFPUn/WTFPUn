# 🌌 Umm, Hi

Having a life goal is me, I'm starting to study Frontend Web developer since mid-2021 and try to code frontend by using ReactJS/NextJS, at the start of 2022 I learn about Backend and API for finding opportunities to make money. It's just started but I feel I'll be better and use them to make money. before I learn Web Developing I love Data and Data Scientists. That makes me see that data is very important and It hard to learn because Data science based on math and that makes me try hard💪 and learn quickly!!
